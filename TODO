DONE round answers to the 2 decimals by default, and option to give how many

DONE retidy the diff_sum() in cf_calcualtions.py
DONE deal with negative number being passed to factorisation()

DONE create test for quadaratic and linear_equations
--- probably rename quadaratic to quadratic equation or probaly a better abbre.

--- see how i can output the equation in a better format


--- factorisation
    -- return list of factorisation

--- sum of the factors that corresponds

--- solve linear equation
    DONE implementation

--- finish and tidy up the quadaratic equation
