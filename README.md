# My Mathematical Library

Welcome to my personal mathematics implementation of a mathematical library. This project
is inspired by revisiting the concepts presented in the book "Engineering Mathematics" by K.A. Stroud and represents my effort to impelement the mathematical concepts through code. The process of revisiting the code has been a source of inspiration for coding challenges and exploration.

While the foundation is based on the concepts from the book, I have incorporated examples from various resources, including other books and the internet.

## Project Overview
- **Impelementation:** This mathematical library is my own interpretation and coding implementation of concepts learned from "Engineering Mathematics" by K.A. Stroud.

- **Source:** The concepts examples used in this book project are not limited to the content of
single book. I've drawn inspiration from various resources, including other books and online references.

- **Algorithm:** The algorithms implemented may not be perfect or the most optimal. I
acknowledge that there is always room for improvement. I am open to suggestions, and help from
the community to enhance the library.

## Getting involved
If you're intrested in contributing or providing feedback, feel free to:
- Open an issue for suggestions or bugs.
- Fork the repository and submit a pull request.
- Reach out with any ideas, improvements, or collaboration opprotunites.

## Goal of the project
The primary aim of this project is to solidify my coding skills and explore the depths
of a larger coding endeavor. I am excited to see how far I can push my abilities while
working on a project of this scale.

Please, feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the growth of this mathematical library.
Let's learn and code together.

Happy coding
